mainAnalysis.m will run most of the analyses and generate the according figures. utils/ contains all the required packages for the code. The eLife analysis is done using another script in eLifeAnalysis/, the generated file will be required by mainAnalysis.m to generate the final figure. We included this fil in eLifeAnalysis/

The folder figs/ contains all the final figures.
